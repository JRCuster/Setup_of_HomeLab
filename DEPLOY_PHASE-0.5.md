# Deployment Phase 0.5: Intermediate Configuration and Optimization

This document outlines the intermediate steps for additional configurations and optimizations after the initial Docker setup and before testing in the development environment.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of steps in `DEPLOY_PHASE-0.md`
- Docker and Docker Compose are still running on your machine
- Git repository is up to date

## Step 1: Optimize Docker Images

Review the Docker images for any unnecessary layers or files that can be removed to optimize the image size and build time.

## Step 2: Configure Docker Networking

Set up and test Docker networking to ensure that containers can communicate with each other as expected. This may involve configuring Docker networks or adjusting service settings in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Step 3: Set Up Volume Persistence

Configure volumes for data persistence, especially for services like databases, to ensure that data is not lost when containers are restarted or rebuilt.

## Step 4: Implement Logging and Monitoring

Set up logging for your application and services. This may involve configuring logging drivers in Docker or setting up a centralized logging system.

## Step 5: Security Review

Conduct a security review of your Docker setup. This includes checking for any exposed ports, default credentials, and ensuring that sensitive information is not included in your Docker images or source code.

## Step 6: Test Individual Services

Run each service individually using `docker-compose` to ensure they are configured correctly and can start without issues.

```bash
docker-compose up <service-name>
```

## Step 7: Automated Testing

Implement automated tests that can be run in the Docker environment. This may include unit tests, integration tests, and any other automated tests that are part of your CI/CD pipeline.

## Step 8: Review Configuration Files

Double-check all configuration files, including `docker-compose.yml`, Nginx configurations, and any other related files, for accuracy and completeness.

## Step 9: Document Intermediate Changes

Document any changes made during this phase, including optimizations, configurations, and any troubleshooting steps taken.

## Conclusion
This phase involves intermediate configurations and optimizations that are crucial for a stable and efficient deployment. Ensure that all changes are documented and tested before moving on to the next phase.

Once you have completed these intermediate steps, your Docker environment should be more secure, optimized, and ready for the full testing phase outlined in `DEPLOY_PHASE-1.md`.
