# User Manual

This document serves as a manual for users to understand how to use the HomeLab dashboard and services.

The dashboard can be accessed at `http://<master-node-ip>:8000/dashboard/`. Replace `<master-node-ip>` with the IP address of the master node where the dashboard is hosted.

## Navigating the Dashboard
- The main page provides an overview of the cluster status and health of various services.
- Use the navigation menu to access different sections, such as system metrics, service logs, and configuration settings.

## Interpreting Monitoring Data
- **Cluster Status**: Indicates the overall health and status of the Docker Swarm cluster. Look for any nodes or services that are down or in an unhealthy state.
- **Service Health**: Provides a summary of the health status for each deployed service. Green indicates healthy, while red indicates issues that need attention.

## Responding to Alerts
- Alerts are configured to notify you of potential issues with the cluster or services.
- When you receive an alert, access the dashboard to view detailed information about the issue.
- Use the provided metrics and logs to diagnose and troubleshoot the problem.
- If necessary, consult the setup guide or contact support for assistance with resolving the issue.

## Performing Common Tasks
- **Viewing Logs**: Access the logs section to view recent logs from the cluster and services.
- **Updating Services**: Use the update feature to pull the latest images and redeploy services.
- **Changing Configuration**: Navigate to the settings section to update configuration parameters for services and the dashboard.

## Managing and Responding to Alerts
- Review and update alerting rules in the `compose/prometheus/alert_rules.yml` file as needed.
- Customize the Alertmanager configuration in `compose/prometheus/alertmanager.yml` to route alerts to your preferred notification channels.
- Test the alerting system by triggering test alerts and verifying that notifications are received correctly.
- Document any new alerts or changes to the alerting process in the `USER_MANUAL.md` and `SETUP_GUIDE.md` files.

## Dashboard Design and Theme
- The dashboard features a "fantasy" theme with a unique color scheme and graphics that enhance the user experience.
- Navigate through the dashboard using the main menu to access different functionalities and view service metrics.
- Interactive elements such as charts and graphs provide real-time data visualization and insights into the system's performance.

## Troubleshooting Guide
- If you encounter issues accessing the dashboard, ensure that the HomeLab services are running and that your network settings are correctly configured.
- For problems with service metrics not displaying, verify that Prometheus and Grafana are correctly set up and that the dashboard is able to fetch data from these services.
- Consult the logs for any services that are not operating correctly. Logs can provide detailed error messages and stack traces that are useful for diagnosing issues.

## Maintenance Guide
- Regularly update your Docker images to the latest versions to receive the latest features and security updates.
- Monitor disk space usage and perform clean-up if necessary to prevent services from running out of space.
- Back up your configuration files and databases periodically to prevent data loss.

## Security Guidelines for Users
- Always keep your login credentials confidential and use strong, unique passwords.
- Ensure that your connection to the HomeLab dashboard is secure, indicated by 'https' in the URL.
- Log out of the dashboard when access is no longer needed, especially on shared devices.
- Report any suspicious activity or security concerns to the system administrator immediately.

Following these guidelines will help protect your account and the HomeLab system from unauthorized access and potential security threats.
