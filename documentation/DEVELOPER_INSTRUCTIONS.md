# Developer Instructions

This document provides guidelines and instructions for developers contributing to the HomeLab project.

## Setting Up the Development Environment
1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your development machine.
2. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker images:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```
4. Start the development environment:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Coding Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- Use descriptive variable names and keep functions focused on a single task.
- Write comments and documentation for complex logic.
- Ensure frontend code is organized and follows best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Running Tests
- Execute the test suite using the Django test runner:
  ```
  docker-compose exec web python manage.py test
  ```
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Contributing to the Project
- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
- Develop your feature or apply your bug fix, writing tests to cover new code.
- Rebase your branch if necessary to incorporate updates from the main branch.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes and any relevant issue numbers.

## Code Reviews
- Request a code review from a fellow developer or maintainer after submitting your pull request.
- Address any feedback provided during the code review process.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Familiarize yourself with the CI/CD pipeline defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
- Ensure that your changes pass all stages of the pipeline before merging.

## Documentation
- Update `USER_MANUAL.md` and `SETUP_GUIDE.md` if your changes affect setup procedures or user workflows.
- Provide inline documentation and update `README.md` as necessary.
## Project Management Dashboard
- Familiarize yourself with the project management dashboard tool being used (e.g., Google Sheets, Trello, Jira).
- Ensure that your tasks and progress are regularly updated in the dashboard for accurate tracking.
- Use the dashboard to coordinate with other team members and avoid duplication of work.
- If you are responsible for a subproject, keep its section of the dashboard up-to-date with the latest status and milestones.

## Snapshotting Dashboard Data to a Database
- If the project requires historical tracking of progress, set up a system to snapshot the dashboard data to a database.
- This can be done through automated scripts that run at regular intervals, depending on the capabilities of the project management tool and the database system.

By maintaining an accurate and up-to-date project management dashboard, the team can ensure that all members are aligned and informed about the project's progress and deadlines.
## Security Best Practices
- Follow secure coding practices and regularly review code for potential security issues.
- Use Django's built-in security features to protect against common threats such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.
- Keep all third-party libraries and dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
- Ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks for all API endpoints and sensitive areas of the application.

By adhering to these security best practices, developers can help maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the HomeLab system and its data.

By following these instructions, developers can contribute effectively to the HomeLab project, ensuring a high standard of quality and maintainability.
